My favorite tools for **enhancing** your **book reading** experience

## Goodreads
This is my main reference point of all things books, including [[Tech/Tags\|Tags]] of each book

- Managing and sharing [book lists](https://www.goodreads.com/list/popular_lists)
- Managing book [[Tech/Tags\|Tags]]
- Create [[Reference/Books/Reading Challenge\|Reading Challenge]]
- Getting free library books
- Phone [book scanning](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/913-goodreads-hack-scan-a-book-cover)

## Browser Tools
Next you will want to facilitate finding and tagging any book you come across in news mentions, blogs, websites, Amazon, library pages, etc.  
I do most of my research in a browser (not phone)  
I use these **browser addons** to auto-lookup books I am interested in

- [GR Right Click](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodreads-right-click/fbicpmopjallgdpklipffmihodimmcbe?hl=en) (Chrome, Brave)¬† [GR Easy Search](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodreads-easy-search/) (Firefox)  
- Search for book in [[Reference/Books/Reading Challenge\|Reading Challenge]] from any web page

### Library Extension
I prefer to get books from **libraries** rather than buy them -- [[Vision/Minimalism\|Minimalism]]  
This lets me grab hardcopy, audiobook, or ebook quickly.
- [Install Library Extension](https://www.libraryextension.com/) on favorite browser (Chrome, Brave)
- Right click the books icon in your browser bar and choose Options  
![image-5.png](/img/user/Reference/Attachments/image-5.png)
- Choose Country and State/Region
- [Add you library(ies)](https://www.libraryextension.com/help/adding-a-library/) for one-click borrows  
    The more the merrier to increase finding books
- Add [Hoopla](https://www.libraryextension.com/help/adding-hoopla-as-a-catalog/) - Hoopla offers free digital books through the library
- Add Internet Archive - (maybe)
